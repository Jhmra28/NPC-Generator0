# NPC Generator 3000

NPC Generator 3000 is a simple Python script that generates a set of random Non-Playable Characters (NPCs) with various attributes including name, age, height, and money. 
You can specify some variables or let the generator choose them randomly. This script is useful for game development, story creation, or any scenario requiring unique character profiles.

## ‚≠ê Features

- **Randomized Names**: Generates names based on gender and age.
- **Customizable Age Range**: Define a minimum and maximum age for NPCs.
- **Random Characteristics**: Assigns each NPC three random characteristics from a list.
- **Dynamic Height and Money**: Height and money are based on the age of the NPC, adding more realism to profiles.
- **NPC Count**: The user can specify the number of NPCs to generate.
- **User Experience**: Multiple functions are built in for error handling and user experience. If you do not want to enter any parameters, there is an option to do that.
